CS 255 Portfolio Reflection – DriverPass System
Project Summary

The client for this project was DriverPass, a company focused on improving student success rates on DMV driving exams. DriverPass requested a web-based training and scheduling system that would allow customers to register accounts, access online practice tests, schedule in-person driving lessons, and track their progress. In addition to customer functionality, the system needed to support multiple internal roles—including a secretary, drivers, an owner, and an IT administrator—each with specific permissions and responsibilities. The goal of the system was to centralize lesson scheduling, ensure DMV test content stayed current, and provide a secure, role-based platform for both customers and staff 

What I Did Well

One area I performed particularly well was translating business requirements into a clear and structured system design. I ensured that each functional requirement identified in the business requirements document was reflected in the UML diagrams and technical architecture. The use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams clearly illustrate how users interact with the system and how data flows between components. I also paid close attention to role-based access control, ensuring that sensitive operations such as account management, scheduling, and package control were limited to authorized users only 

Area for Improvement

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the visual clarity and organization of the UML diagrams, especially those involving multiple actors. While the diagrams are functionally correct, reducing visual complexity and grouping related interactions more tightly would improve readability for nontechnical stakeholders. In a future revision, I would also include brief annotations on diagrams to help explain key interactions at a higher level.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted user needs by closely analyzing the interview scenario and identifying both explicit requirements (such as lesson scheduling and practice tests) and implicit needs (such as security, usability, and scalability). These needs were implemented through role-based permissions, validated inputs, secure authentication, and a modular system design. Considering user needs is critical because a system that does not align with real user workflows—even if technically sound—will fail to deliver value. Designing with the user in mind ensures usability, efficiency, and long-term adoption 

My Software Design Approach

When designing software, I begin with requirements analysis, followed by breaking the system into logical components using UML modeling. I rely on techniques such as use case modeling to define system behavior, activity diagrams to map workflows, and class diagrams to structure data and relationships. In the future, I would continue using iterative design strategies, stakeholder feedback, and modular architectures to ensure systems remain adaptable and maintainable as requirements evolve. This structured approach helps reduce development risks and ensures alignment between business goals and technical implementation.
